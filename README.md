Obsidian plugin that will generate a canvas from a given MOC note



# Status

- [x] Figure out how to use edit obsidian canvases. Explanation below
  1. Read the file
  2. JSON.parse the file into the canvas interface specified in the obsidian api
  3. Edit this interface
  4. Update the file and SEE THE CHANGES
- [x] Implement the plugin
  - Currently works. Creates a circle of the outlinks around the MOC note node
  - I used cool trig for this
- [ ] Update Design and add some settings (spacing etc...)
  - [ ] Is the cirlcle view the best?
  - [ ] What should the spacing between each node be?


# Credits
The idea for this plugin came from a reddit comment requesting this feature; u/J4nosch wrote this comment.
